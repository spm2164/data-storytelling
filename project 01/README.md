So, this is currently a very boring project. My plan was to get some sweet flood damage stats and then make a super long line graph with wave style peaks and troughs that you would scroll right to make the flood waters rise and crash over. What I have here is pretty skeletal, but it does actually do that (sort of). Since the d3 gods decided to update and break all useful examples on the internet, I actually had to downgrade my d3 version to 3 just to get a custom interpolator (which I believe I need, to get this to work) to make the wave shapes function. Very tragic and a huge time sink.

Getting the data wasn't hard, nor was setting up everything else, but man, that custom interpolator. I tried every single v4 built in interpolator and it just did not look anything like I wanted. If I could just get one to work convincingly, the next step would have been to layer a bunch on top of each other, so I could make kind of a cool colored pencil type effect, and then maybe add whitecaps to the very high waves, or add extra arcs to the very very high waves that would crash down. Since I barely got the wave shape off the ground, those things all remain in the imagineering phase.
