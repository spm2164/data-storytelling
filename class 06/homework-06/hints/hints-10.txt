You're just doing the same thing you did in Step 9! But this time with data filtered to only be north america or whatever continent is selected.

Step 2. Update the axis using that scale
Step 3. Look in the Powerpoint about how to do Step 2 if you can't figure it out because I haven't built a page on the site yet!
