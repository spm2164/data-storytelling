You'll need to add the button elements yourself




























They'll each need to be uniquely identifiable. How do you do that?




























Listen for a click on each button separately - each one gets a different function, you don't need to do it all at once (although you technically could)



























You SHOULD do this with classes, but you COULD also do it with filter. http://jonathansoma.com/lede/storytelling/d3/selecting-visible-elements/


















You'll be using selectAll without data binding, without enter, and without append.




















Opacity is good for fading things out, it can be set between 0 and 1.




























If you're going the class route: "N. America" can't be a class, you'll want to do "n-america". How do you get rid of the . and the space?
